FIRST TASK ALBSOLUTIONS INTERNSHIP

Task 1 - Web scrapping form 4 different websites. Using Selenium

I chose Selenium because it is one of the most popular python libraries for automating tasks, and one of the most known for web scrapping.
This is good because it can also take info from JavaScript web pages, so those that are dynamic, rather than other libraries that
work for static html pages only.

I started watching a video from freecodecamp to understand more about selenium first, trying to understand how it works, especially
because I do not have strong foundations in Python, only some slight knowledge.
However, that tutorial was outdated, so i opted for another youtube video, from tech with tim. I am creating everything just like he 
is doing, so that I can learn with him.

We need to import webdriver so we can automate the opening of a web browser.
We then instantiate the class.
We need to download the chrome driver from a separate link.
Link to download it: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
Extract it to c:/SeleniumDrivers just so I have it somewhere.

Then I need to access the executable using a service, just as below 
service = Service(executable_path="C:/SeleniumDrivers/chromedriver.exe")

After that, I use this service path to initiate my driver, just as follows:
driver.get("https://www.google.com")

Now if i run, the driver will open and close immediately, thats why i made a 10 secs timer so i can see it for a little bit.
import time
time.sleep(10)

Now lets try to make a search in google
First lets find using inspect the class the search field has, so I can access it.
    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import by
    input_element = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "gLFyf")

After this, I can write something in the search field, after already accessing it earlier.
    from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import keys
    input_element.send_keys("andri pashollari" + Keys.ENTER)

We can create the following code to wait 5 seconds for this element to appear 
    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
    from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
    WebDriverWait(driver, 5).until(
        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "gLFyf"))
    )

If we then want to click a certain link, we can use the click() function of the element
    link = driver.find_element(By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT, "Andri Pashollari")
    link.click()

Now we will try a new website called cookie clickers
